</h2>
<p>This vignette walks users through the mechanics of the functions that
produce all of the Analysis workflow output within the
<a href="https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm.core" class="external-link">gsm.core</a> package. The suite of <code>{gsm}</code>
packages leverages Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) and thresholds to conduct
study-level and site-level Risk Based Monitoring for clinical
trials.</p>
<p>These functions provide data frames, visualizations, and metadata to
be used in reporting and error checking at clinical sites. The image
below illustrates the supporting functions that feed into the yaml
workflow that is specified in each analysis workflow.</p>
<p><img src="data_analysis.png" style="width:100.0%"></p>
<p>All of these functions will run automatically and sequentially when a
user calls upon the <code><a href="../reference/RunWorkflow.html">RunWorkflow()</a></code> function with a specified
yaml file for KRI metrics found in the <code>workflow/2_metrics</code>
directory of the <a href="https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm.kri" class="external-link"><code>{gsm.kri}</code></a>
package.</p>
<p>Each of these individual functions can also be run independently
outside of a specified yaml workflow.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this documentation, we will evaluate the input(s)
and output(s) of each individual function for a specific KRI to show the
stepwise progression of how a yaml workflow is set up to handle and
process data.</p>

<h3 id="case-study---step-by-step-adverse-event-kri">Case Study - Step-by-Step Adverse Event KRI<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#case-study---step-by-step-adverse-event-kri"></a>
</h3>
<p>We will use sample clinical data simulated with the <a href="https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm.datasim" class="external-link"><code>{gsm.datasim}</code></a>
package to run the Adverse Events (AE) Assessment, i.e.,
<code>AE_Assess()</code>, using the normal approximation method.</p>
<p>Additional statistical methods and supporting functions are explored
in <a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a>.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="create-dfinput">1. Create <code>dfInput</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-dfinput"></a>
</h4>
<p>Start by creating <code>dfInput</code> using sample rawplus data
created with <code>{gsm.datasim}</code>. Note that
<code><a href="../reference/Input_Rate.html">Input_Rate()</a></code> requires three specific clinical datasets,
which include a subject-level demographics/exposure dataset
(<code>dfSubjects</code>) and a domain-level dataset
(<code>dfNumerator</code>) that records every adverse event per
subject.</p>
<p>Since <code><a href="../reference/Input_Rate.html">Input_Rate()</a></code> is a generalized function, it is also
required that you specify the relevant column names for the Subject
(<code>strSubjectCol</code>), Group (<code>strGroupCol</code>) and
optionally the Denominator (<code>strDenominatorCol</code>) and
Numerator (<code>strNumeratorCol</code>) when it is not simply
“Denominator” or “Numerator”, respectively.</p>
<p>Finally, the method for calculating the Numerator and Denominator is
specified in <code>strNumeratorMethod</code> and
<code>strDenominatorMethod</code> as either “Count” or “Sum”. If the
method is “Count”, the function simply counts the number of rows in the
provided data frame. If the numerator method is “Sum”, the function
takes the sum of the values in the specified column
(<code>strNumeratorCol</code> or <code>strDenominatorCol</code>).</p>

<p>The data frame <code>dfInput</code> for an AE assessment will be
created by running <code><a href="../reference/Input_Rate.html">Input_Rate()</a></code> and will have one record
per subject, with the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>SubjectID</code>: Subject Identifier</li>
<li>
<code>GroupID</code>: Group Identifier</li>
<li>
<code>GroupLevel</code>: Type of Group specified in
<code>GroupID</code> (Country, Site)</li>
<li>
<code>Numerator</code>: Total Time on Treatment (measured in days;
per subject)</li>
<li>
<code>Denominator</code>: Total Number of Event(s) of Interest (in
this example, the number of AEs reported; per subject)</li>
<li>
<code>Metric</code>: Rate of Event Incidence (calculated as
<code>Exposure</code>/<code>Count</code>; per subject)</li>
</ul>

<p>The data frame <code>dfTransformed</code> is derived from
<code>dfInput</code> using a <code>Transform()</code> function. In our
example, the analysis pipeline pulls in <code><a href="../reference/Transform_Rate.html">Transform_Rate()</a></code>
since the default metric for AEs is the number of AEs reported over the
course of treatment per site, i.e., a rate.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>The resulting <code>dfTransformed</code> data frame will contain
site-level transformed data, including KRI calculation. Using our
example AE data, <code>dfTransformed</code> contains the following
columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GroupID</code>: Group Identifier (default is Site ID)</li>
<li>
<code>GroupLevel</code>: Type of Group specified in
<code>GroupID</code> (Country, Site)</li>
<li>
<code>Numerator</code>: Cumulative Number of Event(s) of Interest
(in this example, number of AEs reported across subjects)</li>
<li>
<code>Denominator</code>: Cumulative Time on Treatment (in days,
across subjects)</li>
<li>
<code>Metric</code>: Rate of Event(s) of Interest (in this example,
number of AEs reported over the course of treatment in days)</li>

<p>The data frame <code>dfAnalyzed</code> is derived from
<code>dfTransformed</code> using an <code>Analyze()</code> function,
which incorporates a specific statistical model. The resulting
<code>dfAnalyzed</code> data frame will contain site-level analysis
results data. The normal approximation method is the default statistical
model for AE data, so the analysis pipeline automatically runs
<code><a href="../reference/Analyze_NormalApprox.html">Analyze_NormalApprox()</a></code>.</p>

<p>Using our example AE data, <code>dfAnalyzed</code> contains the
following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GroupID</code>: Group Identifier (default is Site ID)</li>
<li>
<code>GroupLevel</code>: Type of Group specified in
<code>GroupID</code> (Country, Site)</li>
<li>
<code>Numerator</code>: Cumulative Number of Event(s) of Interest
(in this example, number of AEs reported across subjects); Carried from
<code>dfTransformed</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>Denominator</code>: Cumulative Time on Treatment (in days,
across subjects); Carried from <code>dfTransformed</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>Metric</code>: Rate of Event(s) of Interest (in this example,
number of AEs reported over the course of treatment in days); Carried
from <code>dfTransformed</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>OverallMetric</code>: Aggregate metric for the group that is
being assessed. ( sum(Numerator) / sum(Denominator) ).</li>
<li>
<code>Factor</code>: Calculated over-dispersion adjustment factor
(mean of the z-score sum of squares calculated in the analysis
functions).</li>
<li>
<code>Score</code>: Calculated Residual (per site).</li>
</ul>

<p>The default flagging function for the normal approximation method is
<code><a href="../reference/Flag.html">Flag()</a></code> and the default threshold is (-3, -2, 2, 3). Using
our example AE data, <code>dfFlagged</code> contains the following
columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GroupID</code>: Group Identifier (default is Site ID)</li>
<li>
<code>GroupLevel</code>: Type of Group specified in
<code>GroupID</code> (Country, Site)</li>
<li>
<code>Numerator</code>: Cumulative Number of Event(s) of Interest
(in this example, number of AEs reported across subjects); Carried from
<code>dfAnalyzed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Denominator</code>: Cumulative Time on Treatment (in days,
across subjects); Carried from <code>dfAnalyzed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Metric</code>: Rate of Event(s) of Interest (in this example,
number of AEs reported over the course of treatment in days); Carried
from <code>dfAnalyzed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>OverallMetric</code>: Aggregate metric for the group that is
being assessed. ( sum(Numerator) / sum(Denominator) ).</li>
<li>
<code>Factor</code>: Calculated over-dispersion adjustment factor
(mean of the z-score sum of squares calculated in the analysis
functions); Carried from <code>dfAnalyzed</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>Score</code>: Calculated Residual (per site); Carried from
<code>dfAnalyzed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Flag</code>: Flag Indicating Possible Statistical Outliers;
Valid values for this variable include -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, which
determine the “extremeness” of the outlier. -2 and 2 represent more
extreme outliers, -1 and 1 represent less extreme outliers, and 0
represents a non-outlier.</li>

</h4>
<p>The data frame <code>dfSummary</code> is derived from
<code>dfFlagged</code> using the <code><a href="../reference/Summarize.html">Summarize()</a></code> function. The
resulting <code>dfSummary</code> data frame will contain the most
relevant columns from <code>dfFlagged</code> with data sorted in a
meaningful way to provide a concise overview of the assessment. Flagged
sites will sort earlier than non-flagged sites, with the more “extreme”
outliers displayed first. The columns in <code>dfSummary</code>
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GroupID</code>: Group Identifier (default is Site ID)</li>
<li>
<code>GroupLevel</code>: Type of Group specified in
<code>GroupID</code> (Country, Site)</li>
<li>
<code>Numerator</code>: Cumulative Number of Event(s) of Interest
(in this example, number of AEs reported across subjects); Carried from
<code>dfAnalyzed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Denominator</code>: Cumulative Time on Treatment (in days,
across subjects); Carried from <code>dfAnalyzed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Metric</code>: Rate of Event(s) of Interest (in this example,
number of AEs reported over the course of treatment in days)</li>
<li>
<code>Score</code>: Calculated Residual (per site)</li>
<li>
<code>Flag</code>: Flag Indicating Possible Statistical Outliers;
Valid values for this variable include -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, which
determine the “extremeness” of the outlier. -2 and 2 represent more
extreme outliers, -1 and 1 represent less extreme outliers, and 0
represents a non-outlier.</li>
